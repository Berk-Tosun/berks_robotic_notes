Spatial Velocity
----------------

Spatial velocity is defined as a :ref:`dynamics/Fundamentals:set of vector fields`. It is different then the conventional
sense of velocity. Conventional velocity is defined as a single vector.

A good way to think of the spatial velocity is to think that the body extends to
infinity in all directions. All points on body will have a certain velocity in the
conventional sense. All these conventional velocity vectors create a vector field
which we define as the spatial velocity.

Let's continue with an example.

Spinning Top
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example: spinning top on a cart.

        Corresponding vector field for velocity (top view)

        Note the vector field will change over time.

Relationship between conventional velocities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting 2 points A and B from the vector field of spinning top.
Their velocities are related as following:

Spatial Velocity in Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As shown above, to get velocity of point B we only need
:math:`v_A(t), \omega(t)`. We can define B as any point in the 
vector space, then compute its velocity. That means :math:`v_A(t), \omega(t)` is sufficient to  
uniquely define the vector field.

For rigid body motion assigning a coordinate frame to point A.

.. attention::

  The set of vectors describing rigid body velocities is a 6-dim vector space.
