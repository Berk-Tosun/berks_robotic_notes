Course
======

* In my notes, I used Patrick M. Wensing's course `Optimization-Based Robotics 
  <http://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/ame-60621/>`_ to create the outline. In addition,
  I embed his course notes into my notes.

  * You can get the course notes from the website.     
  * Use an e-mail and ask Professor Wensing for the recording of previous
    lectures. 

* A related, 
  more control-focused course is Russ Tedrake's `Underactuated Robotics 
  <http://underactuated.mit.edu/index.html>`_.

  * There is an online book.
  * The lectures are available on YouTube.


I am grateful to both for their amazing work.
